# Wubuntu Setup

This document outlines my installation setup for Wubuntu on the multiple systems I currently use. This is a test as I have never used Wubuntu before; preliminary thoughts: pretty good, to be honest.

[Wubuntu Official Site](https://wubuntu.org/)

## Wubuntu on Proxmox

### Install

1. Download the package from [here](https://wubuntu.org/).
2. For Proxmox, upload it to where you store your ISO Images (I have it on my NAS).

Now we create a VM to boot off it. Itâ€™s pretty good; you can boot into the ISO, and it is a fully functioning desktopâ€”if you donâ€™t want to save anything. But at least you can have a play and see if you like it before moving forward and wasting a lot of time.

On the desktop, there is a file that we will click on to actually install it, but that comes shortly.

### Create VM

1. Go to the Node you want to use and click on **Create VM**.
2. Iâ€™m going to assume you know how to do this bit; it's not difficult.

The key is to make sure you use the ISO as the CDROM.

Itâ€™ll take a couple of seconds to create, and now we can start it! ðŸ˜Š

*Note: My VMs were locked out, and I had to fiddle with it and reboot the node before it worked. It was very strange.*

## Wubuntu on Desktop

This will be installed on an old NUC for me with no WiFi :(

### Install

1. Download the package from [here](https://wubuntu.org/).
2. Install on a USB drive using [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

## Generic Setup for All Installs

### Write a Script to Install Multiple Applications

There are many ways to do this, but this is the method I am going to use. All files are attached.

#### Using a Plain Text File

The way I install multiple applications in one go is by using a script with a plain text file.

To that end, letâ€™s first create a file, `ubuntu_app_list.txt`, that contains the names of the applications we want to install:

```bash
cat app_list.txt
wget
elinks
dconf-cli
```

##Generic Setup for all installs

ooh, before I forget, before you do any of the below it is best to run the following commads to make sure everything is up to date
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
You will need to enter your password for sudo.

Write a Script to Install Multiple Applications
There are many ways to do this, but this is the way I am going to use.  All files are attached.
Using a Plain Text File
The way I install multiple applications in one go is by using a script with a plain text file.

To that end, letâ€™s first create a file, ubuntu_app_list.txt for example, that contains the names of the applications we want to install:
```bash
cat app_list.txt
wget
elinks
dconf-cli
```
Each entry should reside on a separate line. Next, we create a script, install_from_file.sh:
```bash
cat > install_from_file.sh
#!/bin/bash
app_file=$1
sudo apt update -y
while IFS= read -r app
do
  echo "installing "$app""
  sudo apt -qq install "$app" -y
done < "$app_file"
```
Letâ€™s try to understand the main elements of this script:

â€¢	app_file contains the path to the plain text file as passed via the first command-line argument
â€¢	the while loop reads lines from the file specified by $app_file using the read command
â€¢	IFS= prevents leading and trailing whitespace from being trimmed from each line
â€¢	the -r option of read preserves backslashes in the lines
â€¢	the > redirection operator at the end of the loop supplies the input file contents
Here, the above script takes a plain text file as input via the command line argument $1.  It then updates the software repository. Each line of the file should contain the name of an application to be installed.

Furthermore, the while loop uses the IFS= read -r app command to read a line from the app_file file into the app variable. The while loop then installs the applications until there are no more lines to read from the app_file file.

Also, it displays messages for each installation step.

Letâ€™s make the above script executable:
```bash
chmod +x install_from_file.sh
```
Then, we run the script with the name of the text file as an argument. This installs the packages listed in the text file:
```bash
./install_from_file.sh app_list.txt
```
Particularly, this method keeps a consistent list of application installations over multiple systems. However, it requires us to create and maintain a plain text file.
